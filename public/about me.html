    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Yasfa Zafar, and I am a computer science student at Punjab University. I am passionate about the ever-evolving world of technology and am dedicated to mastering the skills necessary to become a proficient and innovative developer.

        My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python and C++, and has provided me with a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures. I am particularly interested in web development, artificial intelligence, and data science, and I continually seek opportunities to expand my knowledge in these areas.
        
        Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy engaging in various hobbies that complement my studies.  I love exploring new technologies and frameworks, often working on personal projects to apply what I've learned in class.
        
        In my free time, I enjoy reading tech blogs. These activities not only provide a creative outlet but also help me sharpen my problem-solving skills and think critically.
        
        I am excited about the future of technology and am committed to contributing to innovative projects that can make a positive impact on society. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me!</p>
